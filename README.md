## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Been programming since 13 and the addiction has only devoured me since (in the best possible ways).

These days I mostly work on:
- authentication: ([Guard](https://github.com/oracularhades/guard), [Hades-Auth](https://github.com/oracularhades/hades-auth))
- infrastructure tooling ([Rover](https://github.com/oracularhades/rover), Coastguard (error monitoring), database management, etc)
- quality-of-life tooling ([Mindmap](https://github.com/oracularhades/mindmap))
- protocols and privacy/security
- but really whatever I and others find useful. I make a lot of tools that aren't public just for the sake of solving an issue

Most of my code is not on Github, and the code on Github is not in their full forms. I haven't released it to avoid someone else taking credit for it, before it's in full form. I will do spring cleaning at somepoint, go through all the code on my laptop, write documentation, and put it up.

Languages I currently use:
- Rust
- Node.js/Typescript
- C#
- Zoomer

...soon to be Python and others.
