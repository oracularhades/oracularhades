## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Been programming since 13 and the addiction has only devoured me since (in the best possible ways).

I mostly work on authentication ([Guard](https://github.com/oracularhades/guard), [Hades-Auth](https://github.com/oracularhades/hades-auth)), infrastructure workflows ([Rover](https://github.com/oracularhades/rover), Coastguard (error monitoring), database management, etc), protocols and privacy/security these days. Most of my code is not on Github, and the code on Github still is not in their full forms. I haven't released it to avoid someone else taking credit for it, before it's in full form. I will do spring cleaning at somepoint, go through all the code on my laptop, write documentation, and put it up.

Languages I currently use:
- Rust
- Node.js/Typescript
- C#
- Zoomer

...soon to be Python and others.
